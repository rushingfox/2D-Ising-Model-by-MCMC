# 2D Ising model by MCMC (from two approaches: SSF and Wolff)

## A quick introduction

2D Ising model is one of the simplest physical models could show phase transition. Analytical solution of it has been proposed by Onsager, but we could also use simulation way to solve it. Here we use two Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, the first of which is Single Spin Flip (SSF) based on Metropolis Algorithm, and the second one is one of the cluster flip algorithms-Wolff Algorithm. Wolff Algorithm has better performance than SSF.
